Feature: Codebreaker submits guess
  
The code-breaker submits a guess of four numbers.  The game marks the guess
  with + and - signs.
  For each number in the guess that matches the number and position of a number
  in the secret code, the mark includes one +. For each number in the guess
  that matches the number but not the position of a number in the secret code,
  - is added to the mark.
